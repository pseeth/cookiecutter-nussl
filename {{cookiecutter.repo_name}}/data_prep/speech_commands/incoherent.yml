# The purpose of this script is to create datasets of mixtures using Scaper. Given that
# the data is organized properly in the folder babywsj8k, you can set up mixture_parameters
# appropriately to create a dataset. There are three keys in mixture_parameters, each of
# which creates a different dataset - one for training, one for validation, and one for
# testing. Each dataset has the following parameters:

# 'num_mixtures': The number of mixtures to create from this data.
# 'foreground_path': The folder to take the foreground sources from. Here we use the same
#     folder for training, testing, and validation, but they should be different in 
#     practice.
# 'background_path': You can add background noise to the mixtures if desired to make them
#     sound more realistic. Set to None for no background (this probably has bugs in the 
#     way it is currently implemented).
# 'target_path': This is where the generated mixtures and sources go to.
# 'scene_duration': In seconds, how long each mixture in the dataset is.
# 'num_sources': How many sources are in each mixture. Don't set to greater than the number
#     of sound classes.

# Additionally, there is sample_rate, which sets the sample rate of the output mixtures.
# If this is different from the input sample rate, it may take a while. Best to downsample
# ahead of time using the downsample.py script.

# Defaults at the moment are built for the babywsj8k script.
