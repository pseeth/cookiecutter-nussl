5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. This Software is a work in progress. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or "bugs" inherent to this type of software development. For this reason, to the maximum extent permitted by obligatorily applicable law, the Software is provided on an "as is" basis and without warranties of any kind, including without limitation satisfactory quality and conformity, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, or non-infringement of intellectual or industrial property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 4 of this Licence.

However, the UPF will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Software. The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty disclaimer fails of its essential purpose. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of indirect or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be applicable to you.
