A boilerplate for reproducible and transparent computer audition research that leverages
`nussl`, a source separation library. This project uses `cookiecutter
<https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/>`_. *A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and 
sharing research.*
